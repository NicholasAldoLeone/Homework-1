                <p>LA Heavy Armored Operator, Tachanka comes equipped with the deployable mounted RP-46 Degtyaryov machine gun that can be used by both teammates and enemies alike. With a frontal shield to protect incoming fire at the user's head, it can be used to anchor a position and block off corridors or doorways with sustained fire.

                        The Mounted LMG gives a potent level of protection. When deployed, it will cover its area of sight with surprising efficiency.
                        The LMG has a rate of fire of 550 RPM, fully-automatic.
                        The LMG holds 60+1 rounds and has 179 rounds in reserve. It deals a maximum of 66 damage per shot.
                        The LMG has above average environmental destruction capabilities, being able to penetrate through two surfaces with one shot and destroy portions of walls more than other guns.
                        Once deployed, the LMG can be used by anyone.
                        When unmanned, the LMG can be destroyed by gunfire.
                        On the LMG is a frontal shield that protects the user of the Mounted LMG from gunfire that is aimed at their shoulders or above. The shield can take 500 damage before being destroyed.
                        The mount has a turning limitation of a 60 degrees cone in all directions.
                        Aiming down sights on the LMG shows a tighter firing reticle. The user's view is not occluded, but turning of the gun is slowed.
                        Using a Deployable Shield will help users of the turret to be protected from body/leg shots from a given direction.
                        Strategically, the immobile nature of the LMG means good positioning is required for both cover and effectiveness. Its relatively low recoil and clear line-of-sight even when aiming down sights provides excellent coverage on choke points.</p>
